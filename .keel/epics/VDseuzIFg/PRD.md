# Project Operations - Product Requirements

## Problem Statement

The keel engine repository lacks a dedicated scope for tracking and automating its own internal maintenance and operational routines.

## Goals & Objectives

| ID | Goal | Success Metric | Target |
|----|------|----------------|--------|
| GOAL-01 | Implement Watch primitive for time-based mission constraints | Subcommands functional, tests pass, doctor check active | Production ready |
| GOAL-02 | Stabilize engine pacemaker and codify heartbeat rules | No Med-Bay failures, instructions updated | 100% adherence |

## Users

| Persona | Description | Primary Need |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Primary User | The person or team most affected by the problem above. | A clearer path to the outcome this epic should improve. |

## Scope

### In Scope

- [SCOPE-01] The smallest end-to-end change needed to address the problem statement.

### Out of Scope

- [SCOPE-02] Follow-on improvements or adjacent work that is not required for the first outcome.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<!-- BEGIN FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS -->
| ID | Requirement | Goals | Priority | Rationale |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| FR-01 | Deliver the primary user workflow for this epic end-to-end. | GOAL-01 | must | Establishes the minimum functional capability needed to achieve the epic goal. |
<!-- END FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS -->

### Non-Functional Requirements

<!-- BEGIN NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS -->
| ID | Requirement | Goals | Priority | Rationale |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| NFR-01 | Maintain reliability and observability for all new workflow paths introduced by this epic. | GOAL-01 | must | Keeps operations stable and makes regressions detectable during rollout. |
<!-- END NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS -->

## Verification Strategy

| Area | Method | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Problem outcome | Tests, CLI proofs, or manual review chosen during planning | Story-level verification artifacts linked during execution |

## Assumptions

| Assumption | Impact if Wrong | Validation |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| The problem statement reflects a real user or operator need. | The epic may optimize the wrong outcome. | Revisit with planners during decomposition. |

## Open Questions & Risks

| Question/Risk | Owner | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| Which metric best proves the problem above is resolved? | Epic owner | Open |

## Success Criteria

<!-- BEGIN SUCCESS_CRITERIA -->
- [ ] The team can state a measurable user outcome that resolves the problem above.
<!-- END SUCCESS_CRITERIA -->
